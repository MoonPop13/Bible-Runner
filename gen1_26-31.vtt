00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.219
 Then God said, Let us make human beings so that they are like us.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.320
 Let them rule over the fish in the seas and the birds in the sky.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.519
 Let them rule over the livestock and all the wild animals.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.960
 And let them rule over all the creatures that move along the ground.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.460
 So God created human beings in his own likeness.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.399
 He created them to be like himself.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.339
 He created them as male and female.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.920
 God blessed them.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.000
 He said to them,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.560
 Have children so that there will be many of you.

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:36.500
 Fill the earth and bring it under your control.

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:39.759
 Rule over the fish in the seas and the birds in the sky.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.320
 Rule over every living creature that moves on the ground.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.240
 Then God said, I am giving you every plant on the face of the whole earth that produces its own seeds.

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:53.880
 I am giving you every tree that has fruit with seeds in it.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.560
 All of them will be yours for food.

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.780
 I am giving every green plant as food for all the land animals and all the birds in the sky.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.560
 I am also giving the plants to all the creatures

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.420
 that move along the ground. I am giving them to every living thing that breathes. And that's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.719
 exactly what happened. God saw everything he had made, and it was very good. There was evening,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.840
 and there was morning. It was day six.
